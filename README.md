# Word prediction using BERT and other models.
This is Krišjāņa Mārtiņa Allika course project for the NLP and AI course at the University of Latvia, 2021.

## Aim of this
The goal of this project was to better understand NLP, learn python, PyTorch, and machine learning models - how they work, how to create them, how are they used -  and create a model, that helps the user to write a text, by predicting what words could be put into a blank space. 

## Information

This was built on PyTorch. The training data I used was publicly available. It contained HTML tags and other unwanted stuff, hence the data had to be formatted and split into the required files.
